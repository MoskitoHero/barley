Barley is a dead simple, fast, and efficient ActiveModel JSON serializer.

Cerealize your ActiveModel objects into flat JSON objects with a dead simple DSL. Our daily bread is to make your API faster.

## Usage
Add the `Barley::Serializable` module to your ActiveModel object.

```ruby
# /app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Barley::Serializable
end
```

Then define your attributes and associations in a serializer class.

```ruby
# /app/serializers/user_serializer.rb
class UserSerializer < Barley::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name, :email, :created_at, :updated_at

  many :posts
  one :group
end
```

The just use the `as_json` method on your model.

```ruby
user = User.find(1)
user.as_json
```

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "barley"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install barley
```

## DSL

### Attributes
You can define attributes with the `attributes` macro.

```ruby
  attributes :id, :name, :email, :created_at, :updated_at
```

You can also define attributes one by one, or a mix of both.

```ruby
  attributes :id, :name, :email
  attribute :created_at
  attribute :updated_at
```

You can also define a custom attribute with a block. You will have a `object` variable available in the block. It is the object you are serializing.

```ruby
  attribute :full_name do
    "#{object.first_name} #{object.last_name}"
  end
```

### Associations

#### One-to-one
You can define a one-to-one association with the `one` macro.

```ruby
  one :group
```

You can also define a custom association with a block. You will have a `object` variable available in the block. It is the object you are serializing.

```ruby
  one :group do
    object.group.name
  end
```

You can define a custom serializer for the association with the `serializer` option, and / or caching options with the `cache` option.

```ruby
  one :group, serializer: CustomGroupSerializer, cache: { expires_in: 1.hour }
```

You can of course define serializers with inner classes for simple needs.

```ruby 
class UserSerializer < Barley::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name, :email, :created_at, :updated_at

  one :group, serializer: LocalGroupSerializer
  
    class LocalGroupSerializer < Barley::Serializer
        attributes :id, :name
    end
end

```
end
#### One-to-many
You can define a one-to-many association with the `many` macro.

```ruby
  many :posts
```

You can also define a custom association with a block. You will have a `object` variable available in the block. It is the object you are serializing.

```ruby
  many :posts do
    object.posts.map(&:title)
  end
```


## Serialization options
You can pass a hash of options to the `as_json` method.

```ruby
user = User.find(1)
user.as_json(serializer: CustomUserSerializer, cache: { expires_in: 1.hour })
```

Beware, this gem overrides the `as_json` method on your model. Calling `as_json` with `include`, `only`, or `except` options will not work.

Why? We believe it defeats the purpose of this gem. If you want to customize the serialization of your model, you should use a serializer class.


## Caching
Barley supports caching out of the box. Just pass `cache: true` to the `serializer` macro.

```ruby
# /app/models/user.rb
# ...
serializer UserCerealizer, cache: true
```

Or you can pass a hash of options to the `serializer` macro.

```ruby
# /app/models/user.rb
# ...
serializer UserCerealizer, cache: { expires_in: 1.hour }
```

## Fun mode ðŸ¤¡
You can replace all occurrences of `Serializer` with `Cerealizer` in your codebase. Just for fun. And for free.

```ruby
# /app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Barley::Cerealizable
  
  cerealizer UserCerealizer
end

# app/cerealizers/user_cerealizer.rb
class UserCerealizer < Barley::Cerealizer
  attributes :id, :name, :email, :created_at, :updated_at

  many :posts
  one :group
end
```

Ah ah ah. This is so funny.

## Benchmarks

This gem is blazing fast and efficient. It is 2 to 3 times faster than [ActiveModel::Serializer](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) and twice as fast as [FastJsonapi](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi).

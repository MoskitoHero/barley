## ✋ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've discovered a security vulnerability in Barley, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **E-mail us**: Send an e-mail to the maintainers of the project. You can find the contact information in the `README.md` file.

2. **Do not create a public issue**: We ask that you do not create a public issue on GitHub until we've had a chance to address the vulnerability. This helps us to prevent potential exploitation of the vulnerability until a fix is available.

4. **Follow up**: If you don't receive a response within a reasonable time, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in helping us keep Barley safe for everyone.
